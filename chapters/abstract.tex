\newcommand{\projectAbstract}{
The scope of the project at hand is investigating the speech intelligibility, that is achieve via bone-conducted (BC) sound compared to that of airbone sound.
After extensive literature research, a perceptual is designed. A loudness matching routine is developed, speech intelligibility is tested with a procedure, that is a modified version of the Danish Hearing In Noise Test (HINT). The Bone-conduction Intelligibility Evaluation Routine (BIER) is executed with ten normal hearing subjects. The analysis of the results hints towards a worse conduction of the bone conduction tranducer in terms of intelligibility, that cannot be shown to be statistically significant.
