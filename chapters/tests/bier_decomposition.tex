\section{\gls{bier}: \gls{srtn} Analysis}


During the \gls{bier} test, a for each of the of the ten subjects four \gls{srtn}s have been measured, evenly split between \gls{ac} and \gls{bc}.
The values two values for each conductor for each subject are averaged, resulting in a total of 10 pairs of observations to perform statistics on (see \autoref{tab:srtn}).
It is assumed, that the result of the loudness matching part of \gls{bier} (reference to the LM section here ??) leads to a reliable estimate of the \gls{snr} for the \gls{bct} for the \gls{hint} part of \gls{bier}.
In order to determine, if under this assumption there is a statistically significant difference in intelligibility between \gls{ac} and \gls{bc}, a paired-sample t-Test can be performed.\\

Subject     & 1   & 2    & 3    & 4    & 5    & 6    & 7     & 8     & 9    & 10   \\ \hline
Avg. \gls{srtn}\textsubscript{,\gls{ac}} & 2.8 & 1.0  & -2.3 & -3.8 & -7.1 & -2.2 & 11.5  & 0.4   & 11.0 & 4.8  \\
Avg. \gls{srtn}\textsubscript{,\gls{bc}} & 0.7 & 1.6  & 1.1  & -7.2 & -1.3 & -0.6 & 21.5  & 11.4  & 9.7  & 17.5 \\
\gls{srtn}\textsubscript{,AC}-\gls{srtn}\textsubscript{,BC}  & 2.0 & -0.6 & -3.4 & -3.3 & -5.8 & -1.6 & -10.0 & -11.0 & 1.3  & 12.8
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The null hypothesis of the test is, that the difference between the observation pairs is normally distributed and zero mean. If the former hypothesis can be rejected, it can be concluded, that there is a statistically significant difference between the mean \gls{srtn} of the two conductors.
The MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered} function \texttt{ttest} has been applied to the available data from \autoref{tab:srtn}. The null hypothesis can be rejected with a $p$-value of 0.0644. This does reach the commonly apllied significance level of $\alpha=$\SI{5}{\percent}.\\
A normal probability plot of the \gls{srtn} is depicted in \autoref{fig:srtn_normal}. The lines in plot correspond to the normal distribution, that has been derived from estimating mean and variance from the available observations. 
The points depict those observations. Points being close to their corresponding lines indicate, that a normal distribution is likely to underlay the observations. The datapoints in \autoref{fig:srtn_normal} can be considered reasonably close to the corresponding normal distributions, however the number of points is small.\\

For the paired-sample t-test to be viable, it has to be assumed, that the pairs of observations are normally distributed. Hence the distribution of the difference between the two also has to be normally distributed. 
This can be checked by means of a Lilliefors test.
The Lilliefors test checks the null hypothesis, that the input data is coming from a normally distributed population. 
In the given context, the intrasubject difference between the the \gls{ac} \gls{srtn} and the \gls{bc} \gls{srtn} (see  is tested.
The population mean and variance are estimated based on the input data. The null hypothesis is rejected or confirmed, based on the discrepancy between the Gaussian \gls{cdf}, that is derived from the estimated mean and variance and the empirical distribution.
This procedure is conveniently implemented in the MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered} function \texttt{lillietest}.
The null hypothesis, that the intrasubject \gls{srtn} difference is normally distributed, is not rejected at a \SI{5}{\percent} significance level based on the data at hand.\\

\section{Psychometric functions derived from \gls{bier}}

An overview on the background of the psychometric function is given in \citep{wichmann_01}.

The fit has been performed with the MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered} toolbox \texttt{psignifit 4}. The methods, that the toolbox is based on, is described in \citep{schuett_16}.
