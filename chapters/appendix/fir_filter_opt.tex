\chapter{Optimization or \gls{fir} filter}\label{ax:opt_imp_filter}
Optimizing the \gls{fir} beamforming filter is done with the genetic algorithm in \autoref{ax:opt_imp} with slightly modification. To optimize the \gls{fir} filter the cost function code, the mutation code is changed, and there is added crossover in Offspring function \autoref{code:offspring}.


\section*{Materials}
The following materials are used:
\begin{itemize}
\item MATLAB 2017b
\end{itemize}

The following code shows only the changed part of the algorithm.
