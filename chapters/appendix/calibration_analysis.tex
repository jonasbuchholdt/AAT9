\chapter{Calibration analysis of Affinity}
\label{append:affinity_bc_calibration}
A test was made to get a view of the Affinity inputs CD1 and CD2. To decide on the matching between the \gls{ac} and the \gls{bc} it has to be found out if the inputs CD1 and CD2 are calibrated for the used \gls{bc} transducer, meaning that the input voltage relates to a force output of the \gls{bct}. It has been observed in the datasheet for the \gls{bct} that the transducer needs calibration \citep{radioear_b81}. To test if the Affinity 2.0 is calibrated, the input/output voltage relation shall change along the frequency to reach the correct force for every frequency since the transfer function of the \gls{bct} does not match the transfer function from the standard 389-3:2016 \citep{iso_389-3}.

\section*{Materials and setup}
To measure the output voltage for difference frequency input, the following materials are used:

\section*{Test procedure}


\begin{enumerate}
\item The materials are set up as in \autoref{fig:appendix:test_cal_affinity}.
\item The chosen sine tone is \SI{1}{\kilo\hertz}, \SI{2}{\kilo\hertz} and \SI{2}{\kilo\hertz} because they is in the area where the calibration is needed \citep{radioear_b81}.
\item Compare tone is \SI{250}{\hertz} since this tone does not need to be calibrated \citep{radioear_b81}.
\item Put the Fluke intro \gls{acv}. 
\item put the Affinity intro \gls{bc} mode.
\item  Play the \SI{250}{\hertz} sine tone in CD1 and note the voltage.
\item  Play  \SI{1}{\kilo\hertz}, \SI{2}{\kilo\hertz} and \SI{2}{\kilo\hertz} sine tone in CD1 and note the voltage with the same \si{\volt} \gls{rms} as with played with \SI{250}{\hertz}.
\item Compare if there is a difference output voltage for the difference frequency, that correspond to the calibration table in 389-3:2016 \citep{iso_389-3}
\item repeat with CD2 input.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Results}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Test result}
\begin{tabular}{l|ll}
Frequency [\si{\hertz}] & CD1 $V_{rms}$ & CD2 $V_{rms}$ \\ \hline
250                     & 0.703         & 0.705         \\
1000                    & 0.701         & 0.702         \\
2000                    & 0.711         & 0.706         \\
4000                    & 0.704         & 0.702        
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:append_cal_anal_affinity}
\end{table}

On  \autoref{tab:append_cal_anal_affinity} it is seen that the voltage for every frequency is approximately the same, and therefore the Affinity is not calibrated on the CD1 and CD2 inputs.

\section*{Conclusion}
It can be concluded that the gain on the Affinity does not match the hearing threshold when the input is from CD1 and CD2. Therefore the \gls{bc} versus \gls{ac} matching can not be done with the hearing level \gls{spl} on the Affinity. Another method has to be developed while using the CD inputs on the Affinity.
