In order to assess the performance of \gls{bc} and \gls{ac}, a subject based objective test needed to be designed. However, since not all variables could be assessed from an objective perspective, part of this test relies on the subject's perception and the necessary adjustments derived from it.

One key constraint that needed to be taken into account for this test was time, since the procedure itself demands a high level of concentration from the subject and thus couldn't be extended over a long period. Therefore, and after performing some pilot tests, it was decided to limit the total duration to up to \SI{1}{\hour}.
\section{Test Description}
\label{sec:test_description}

As the main focus of this research is the assessment on intelligibility score, the endpoint of it is to compare both types of transducers' performance from the \gls{hint}. However, several previous steps are needed in order to assess the \gls{hint} results correctly. Therefore, the test was divided into three main parts (with an extra step for subject acceptance), and will be referred to as \gls{bier}.

\subsection{Subject acceptance questionnaire}
Previous to accepting possible test subjects, it was necessary to send them a questionnaire according to ISO 389-9:2009 \citep{iso_389-9} in order to perform a quick background check and identify possible unfit candidates. This questionnaire can be found in \autoref{{apend:quest_for_hearing}}.

\subsection{Partial audiometry}
The first part of the test consisted of a reduced audiometry in order to ensure normal hearing amongst the participants. As a first approach, a full audiometry was proposed, but was later discarded since it considerably increased the duration of the test and its difficulty, since it demands a lot of focus from the participants. Furthermore, the added data was not of real use for the experiment due to the bandwidth limitation imposed by the bone transducer.
Therefore, a reduced version was selected, containing 500, 750, 1000, 2000, 3000 and \SI{4000}{\hertz}

This part of the test was divided into three subparts, with a little break between them. The duration of the break was subject-dependant and no longer than 30 seconds.
The first subpart consisted on a familiarisation round with two frequencies (\SI{500}{\hertz} and \SI{1}{\kilo\hertz}) through the right ear in order for the participant to fully understand the procedure. Once this part had been completed, the audiometry for both ears was performed, starting with the left one.

\subsection{Level matching}



This procedure was repeated in three rounds, first one being familiarisation. Each round would consist on up to 4 hits, depending on the subject's consistency and the conductors assessment. Afterwards, the average between the level of all hits would be taken as the \gls{bc} level to use in the last part of the test.



\subsection{\gls{hint}}
The last part of the \gls{bier} corresponds to the performance of the \gls{hint}. This part is divided into five sub-sections, as it has a familiarisation round and four proper test rounds.

During the familiarisation round, half of the sentences were presented through \gls{ac} and the other half through \gls{bc}, while for the test rounds, each whole set of sentences was presented through the same transducer. The noise level was maintained the same for the duration of the whole experiment, both inter-subjects and inter-rounds.

As per danish \gls{hint}'s design, three familiarisation lists are available, as well as ten test lists. The assignation of this sets to each subject/round was done in a randomized way, not allowing list repetition within the subject's test. The selection of \gls{ac} or \gls{bc} transducers was also randomized, not allowing more than two repetitions of the same transducer throughout the whole test.

Therefore, each subject would perform two \gls{ac} rounds and two \gls{bc} rounds, all of them using different lists.
